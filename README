Hi,

This is the Apache::Filter module.  It is meant to run under Apache's
mod_perl.  

It provides functionality similar to Apache::OutputChain, but with a nicer
interface (filters are listed in forward order, not reverse, in httpd.conf;
and you don't need to write two separate modules, one which chains and one
which doesn't [e.g. Apache::SSI and Apache::SSIChain]).

A couple examples of filters are provided with this distribution in the t/
subdirectory: UC.pm converts all its input to upper-case, and Reverse.pm
prints the lines of its input reversed.

For more specific information, please see the documentation inside Filter.pm,
by doing "pod2txt Filter.pm", or "perldoc Apache::Filter" once you've
installed the module.

To install the module:

   <make sure mod_perl is installed>
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
