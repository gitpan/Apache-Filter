Version: 1.008  Date: 2000/04/13 00:53:53
   Added the Apache::RegistryFilter module, which provides support for
   Registry scripts in a Filter chain.
   
   Fixed up the Makefile.PL file a bit.


Version: 1.007  Date: 2000/03/24 15:03:14
   Changed several $r->filename instances to $r->finfo.  This will speed
   up operation.  I did this once in the past, but had to change it back
   to $r->filename because $r->finfo wasn't working right.  mod_perl
   version 1.18 claims to have fixed the problems, so I'm changing it
   forth again.
   
   Fixed a run-time server error that occurs when the input filename
   doesn't exist.  [gyoung@laserlink.net (Geoffrey Young)]


Version: 1.006  Date: 2000/01/29 17:54:44
   Added 'handle' parameter to filter_input().
   [Vegard.Vesterheim@runit.sintef.no (Vegard Vesterheim)]
   
   If $r->filename can't be opened, we no longer abort halfway through
   filter_input().  Just return an undef filehandle at the end.

Version: 1.005  Date: 1999/10/17 15:59:23
   No changes - version bump to update the README file.


Version: 1.004  Date: 1999/10/17 15:47:27
   Fixed a problem that prevented proper functioning when Perl is
   compiled with sfio instead of stdio.  Should work properly now.


Version: 1.003  Date: 1999/09/12 03:25:45
   Forgot to replace Doug's PerlRun documentation with my
   PerlRunFilter documentation in the last release, so I did it now.


Version: 1.002  Date: 1999/09/12 02:22:47
   Added $VERSION stuff to integrate with CVS.


Version: 1.001  Date: 1999/09/12 02:17:10
   Added files to CVS
