Revision history for Perl extension Apache::Filter.

0.04  Wed Nov 11 18:26:56 EST 1998
   - No changes - just discovered that an older version of Apache::SSI
     made its way into the tarball, so I've removed it and given the 
     fixed tarball a new version number.

0.03 (not formally released, because I forgot to add to the Changes file)

   - Added boolean function $r->changed_since($time) to allow modules 
     like Apache::Registry to cache input.
   
   - When $r->filter_input is called in a list context, it now returns two
     values: a filehandle containing the filter's input (as in the previous 
     version), and a status code from Apache::Constants.  This lets filters 
     do things like:
     
        my ($fh, $status) = $r->filter_input();
        return $status unless $status == OK;
        while (<$fh>) {
           # Proceed
           ...
        }
    
   - When performing the open() for the first filter in the list, the return
     value is now checked.
    
   - $r->send_http_header() will now be called when the _last_ filter calls
     $r->filter_input, not when the _first_ one does.  This lets each filter
     add to the outgoing headers, potentially changing the content-type or
     whatever.  I believe Gerald Richter suggested this.
   
   - The Apache::UC (upper-casing) and new Apache::Reverse (line-reversing)
     filter modules are now in the t/ subdirectory, not the lib/ directory.
     Thus they shouldn't get installed when you do "make install".
